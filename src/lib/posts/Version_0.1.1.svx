# Analytics
## Description
With the website hosted I decided to implement some audience analytics, no worries nothing to scary. Those analytics just show how many people visited the page and from which countries the visitors came.  
Additionally I also changed the design of the login and register form to be more pleasing.

## Changes
The following changes and implementations have been made in that version of the project:
* Added [Vercel Audience Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/analytics/audiences/quickstart) (SvelteKit)
* UI change on the login/register form


## Features
âœ… Audience Analytics ðŸ‘€   

## Code
Nothing too interesting happened in this change. Just implementing the analytics the documented way.  
Plus lots of boring css that is not worth sharing.

package.json (npm i @vercel/analytics)
```json
"@vercel/analytics": "^0.1.8",
```

+layout.svelte
```html
<script lang="ts">
    import { dev } from '$app/environment';
    import { inject } from '@vercel/analytics';

    inject({ mode: dev ? 'development' : 'production' });
</script>
```
