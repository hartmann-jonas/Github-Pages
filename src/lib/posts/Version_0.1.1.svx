# Analytics
## Description
With the website hosted I decided to implement some audience analytics, no worries nothing to scary. Those analytics just show how many people visited the page and from which countries the visitors came.  
Additionally I also changed the design of the login and register form to be more pleasing.

## Changes
The following changes and implementations have been made in that version of the project:
* Added [Vercel Audience Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/analytics/audiences/quickstart)
* UI change on the login/refister form


## Features
âœ… Audience Analytics ðŸ‘€
