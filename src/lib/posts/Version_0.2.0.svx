# Recommendations
## Description
In Version 0.2.0 personal recommendations are added, the user will get individualized recommendations for him based on his own interests.

## Changes
The following changes and implementations have been made in that version of the project:
* Big changes to the database
    * New model "Keywords"
    * If a movie gets liked, the keywords are added to the movie

How do we get the recommended movies?
* When visiting the page, all keywords are queried that the user liked
* From those keywords, the top 3 keywords are evaluated based on frequency
* With these keywords an API request is sent to TheMovieDB which returns movies with these keywords
* From the response, the movies that the user has liked are filtered out
