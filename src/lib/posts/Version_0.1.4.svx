# Similarity is key
## Description
The movie page now shows movies that are similar to that one as well as BTS or other videos related to the movie

## Changes
The following changes and implementations have been made in that version of the project:
* Change [themoviedb API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) request to include recommended movies
* Style the movies using the movie card component


## Features
âœ… Similar movie recommended on movie page ðŸŽ¬

## Code
This change is using similar techniques as the "Version 0.0.3" change. Therefore there will just be a really quick rundown of the changed code.

movie/[id]/+page.server.ts
```ts
// append 'recommended' to the fetch url to include 'recommended'
const response = await fetch(
		`https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/${params.id}?api_key=${process.env.TMDB_API_KEY}&append_to_response=videos,keywords,recommendations`
)
```

movie/[id]/+page.svelte
```html
<script>
    // assign the recommended movies to a new variable
    // limit the recommendedMovies to 10 to reduce loading times
    let recommendedMovies = data.props.movieDetail.recommendations.result.slice(0,10)
</script>

<!--Loop over all recommendedMovies and create iframes to show the videos-->
{#if recommendedMovies.length > 0}
    <div class="related-movies">
	    <h4 class="title-text">Related Movies:</h4>
        <div class="movies">
            {#each recommendedMovies as movie}
            <div class="movie-cards m-3">
                <div class="movie-card">
                    <a data-sveltekit-noscroll href={'/movie/' + movie.id} target="_self">
                    {#if typeof movie.poster_path == 'string'}
                        <img class="movie-card-image" src={'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500' + movie.poster_path} alt={movie.title} />
                    {:else}
                        <div class="no-img">
                            <p class="no-img-available">no image available</p>
                        </div>
                    {/if}
                    </a>
                </div>
            </div>
            {/each}
	    </div>
    </div>
{/if}
```
