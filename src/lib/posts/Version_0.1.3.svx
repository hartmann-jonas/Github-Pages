# Likes
## Description
You can now like the movies you love. 

## Changes
The following changes and implementations have been made in that version of the project:
* Added likes to movies
    * Update Prisma schema to have likes in the Movie table
    * Each like is a User that gets connected to the like field of the movie. That way the website knows if you liked the movie and displays the button differently
* Big UI overhaul (color palette, structure of movie components)


## Features
✅ Likes for movies 👍  
✅ New UI ✨
