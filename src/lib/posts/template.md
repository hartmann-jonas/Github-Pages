## How to develop a Movie Website

This blog is about the development and concept of this [Movie Database](https://movie-db-two-hartmann-jonas.vercel.app) website.
The website was developed using [svelte](https://svelte.dev) and the [themoviedb](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3).

## Features

The website has the following features:  
✅ Daily popular movies  
✅ Search movie by name  
✅ User login  
✅ Like movies  
✅ Save movies  
✅ Individualized recommendations  
❌ Links to watch the movie on the movie providers website


## Documentation
How do I document the process developing that website? I set myself some rules to keep each update consistant.
* This post gets updated each time a news feature is introduced
* This post serves as documentation on how to use the site
* Each "Version" post describes the changes that were made as well as new features and includes a link to the GitHub commit
* A "Version" post consists of the following sections: Description, Changes, Features

The "Version" posts follow this template:

    ---
    title: Version 0.0.x
    date: "2023-04-03"
    ---
    ## Version 0.0.1

    ## Description
    Some descriptive text that gives a quick overview on the changes made.

    ## Changes
    More detailed desctiption of the changes:
    1. Fetch function to get this
    2. Restructuring the navbar to improve 
    3.

    To get a better view on the changes proposed in that first version it is easier to watch the tutorial, it gives you a much better insight into what I started with.

    ## Features
    ✅ Popular movies  
    ✅ Search function
