# Login
## Description
After having a good starting point and some inspiration I worked on some login functionality on the website. That way every different user could have the website presented to him in a different way. My teacher recommended this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/E3VG-dLCRUk) by Joy of Code to me on how to implement this functionality using cookies and a prisma database.

## Changes
The following changes and implementations have been made in that version of the project:
* Installed [Prisma](https://prisma.io) and created a client with a SQLite database.
* When user is logged in a cookie is created that saves the current session for 30 days
* Use [SvelteKit Hooks](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/hooks) to store the session for checking if the user is logged in

To get a better view on how the login functionality works, watch the [tutorial](https://youtu.be/E3VG-dLCRUk).
