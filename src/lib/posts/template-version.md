## Version 0.0.1
# Onewordtitle
## Description
Getting started with something is always one of the hardest parts of a project (at least for me). So I decided to use this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/ydR_M0fw9Xc) to help me find my way into Svelte and to give me an idea of what I want to build.

Having done that tutorial, plus some addational research because there were breaking changes with fetching data since the tutorial has been published, I was presented with a nice looking cool website.

## Changes
The following changes and implementations have been made in that version of the project:
* Several fetch functions to the [themoviedb API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) to get the popular and searched movies
* Styling and structuring the page using components
* 

To get a better view on the changes proposed in that first version it is easier to watch the tutorial, it gives you a much better insight into what I started with.

## Features
✅ Popular movies  
✅ Search function
