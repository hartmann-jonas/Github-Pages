# Availability
## Description
Now the website is starting to take more and more shape I decided to take advantage of the insanely powerful API that the website is using. Users can now see where a movie is available in Germany, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, Canada and the US.

## Changes
The following changes and implementations have been made in that version of the project:
* Fetch functions to the [TheMovieDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) to get the availability of the movie
* Styling the icons and `<select>` tag

Bug fixes:
* Added redirect if user that is not logged in goes to the profile page

## Features
‚úÖ Movie availability üåç
